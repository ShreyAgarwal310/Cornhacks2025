This resource management game takes the user on a journey from the year 2000 to 2100. The game allows the player to allocate their funds towards different types of energy sources.

Welcome to Race to 2100, the game that tests your strategy and your global awareness.

You're goal is to get the largest population with the least amounts of deaths.

Your people need energy to survive, and in order to meet this demand, you will
have to invest in energy sources (coal, oil, solar, wind, fission, and fusion).

You can buy and sell energy sources with the green and orange buttons or research
in future energies with the blue buttons which decrease the cost of their respective
energy source, however, you can only make one choice per year. You can also advance
the year without taking action on the top left.

If you do not meet at least 80% of your energy demand, people die.
If you output too much pollution, people die.

Good Luck!
